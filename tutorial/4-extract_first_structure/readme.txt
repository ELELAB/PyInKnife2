# Requirements:
# - Run the script in '../1-make_index'

# In this folder, the script '4-extract_first_structure.sh'
# is used to extract the first structure from the full-length
# trajectory and save it to a PDB file.

# This structure will be used as both topology and reference
# file for the PSN analyses performed with PyInKnife2.

# The Bash line to run the script is:

./4-extract_first_structure.sh

# Be aware that the full-length trajectory is not
# available in the GitHub repository because it is
# too big to be hosted on GitHub. However, we can
# provide the trajectory and the associated topology
# (TPR) file upon request.
