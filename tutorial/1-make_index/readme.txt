# In this folder, the script '1-make_index.sh' is used
# to generate the 'protein.ndx' file, a GROMACS index
# file containing only the indexes of protein atoms
# from the TPR (topology) file associated with the
# full-length trajectory.

# The Bash line to run the script is:

./1-make_index.sh

# Be aware that the full-length trajectory is not
# available in the GitHub repository because it is
# too big to be hosted on GitHub. However, we can
# provide the trajectory and the associated topology
# (TPR) file upon request.
